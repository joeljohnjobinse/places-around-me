        This is Talal Supermarket. 
        <br>
        It's a very popular supermarket chain in UAE.
        <br>
        It gets very crowded almost every day, especially the vegetable area. And even long queues at the billing counter! 
        <br>
        But they do give offers very often, selling goods at very cheap rates compared to others.
        <br>
        We go there every weekend to buy things for the whole week.
