        This is Dubai Airport Free Zone Metro Station. 
        <br>
        It's one of the many other metro stations of the Dubai Metro, and one of three metro stations in Al Qusais.
        <br>
        It's on the Green Line of the Dubai Metro, starting from etisalat to Creek Metro Station.
        <br>
        Traveling on the metro is so much fun - especially exchanging in time at the interchange stations!!!
